# kzaremski.github.io

My Githup Pages portfolio site, built with React. See it live at  [https://kzaremski.github.io](https://kzaremski.github.io).

I tried to rebuild this using the Hugo static site generator, but did not have much luck witht the way that it handles menus.
It largely seems that the builtin functions are pretty good, but as soon as you need to go beyond that or do more customization, that is whne things become difficult.
