              To grow and exercise my full stack knowledge I have been building a web based stock charting and financial analysis platform sporting advanced features typically only found on heavy clients. This is my main personal project
              <br/><br/>I have named the platform Groshi, a Ukranian word for money.

            <h4>Technical Summary</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The general website front end consists of pages rendered by the nunjucks templaing engine, with routing handled by ExpressJS.</li>
              <li>The app itself has a dynamic tiling interface consisting of charting, company info, news, and other info applets arranged by React Mosaic.</li>
              <li>Groshi runs on a Node.js back end using the Express.js web app framework, hosted on Microsoft Azure.</li>
              <li>User accounts, newsletter subscribers, beta keys, and other data is stored using MongoDB.</li>
              <li>Newsletter and account email verification and notifications are handled by Mailgun and their Node.js SDK.</li>
              <li>Data is pulled from the marked data provider (IEX Cloud) using their REST API, cached on Groshiâ€™s system in a Redis cache, then redistributed to clients using my own little WebSockets wrapper as to not cause API overage charges.</li>

            <p className='card-text'>
              I am working to spread awareness about my platform and it's potential within relevant groups. If there is enough interest, my intention is to increase server capacity and follow through with a public release and fully functional product.
