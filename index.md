      Hello! I'm <strong>Konstantin Zaremski</strong>, a software developer specializing in AI/ML and legal technology, based in Littleton, Colorado.
      I have full-stack experience spanning ASP.NET Core, Python, C#, and cloud-native deployments in Microsoft Azure and Kubernetes.
      I'm currently building intelligent systems at Tschetter Sulzer Muccio, with a track record of creating secure internal platforms and innovative solutions.
      <br/><br/>
      Beyond code, I have an eye for the visual and a drive to see projects through to fulfillment.
